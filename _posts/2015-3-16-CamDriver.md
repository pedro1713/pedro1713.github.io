title: My OV7740 driver for the Radxa Rock Pro
---

It's been about two months since I started working on this driver.
It was quite the learning experience.
I didn't know much of writing Linux drivers when I started, I still don't know much but I think now I at least understand the basics.
The driver code can be found [here](https://github.com/pedro1713/7740driver).
It is still a work in progress.
I need to fine tune some register values to make it work.
But I think it is getting there.
