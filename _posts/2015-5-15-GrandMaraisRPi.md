I recently finished a small project for the Grand Marais museum. 
Well actually a couple of weeks ago but it is being installed over the weekend.
It involved a payphone case from the '50s and a Raspberry Pi.
It was an interesting, albeit simple, project.
Mostly because I've been itching for a reason to tinker with a Pi.

Some impressions I got from this project.
Python is really simple, is nice that it comes pre-installed in the Raspbian image.
However, the syntax being so picky about whitespace is annoying. 
I actually got a bug, that took me a while to find just because of a misplaced white space.
Even though I used a number of GPIOs on the Pi I don't think I even scratched the surface of what is capable of.
I will be interesting to see if I can make more projects with it.
Fitting everything inside the pay phone enclosure was an interesting puzzle.

All together, it was a fun an instructive simple project. 
If you ever stop by Grand Marais in Manitoba, give their museum a visit and check the old payphone.
